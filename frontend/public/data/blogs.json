    "content": "# Getting Started with React Hooks\n\nReact Hooks revolutionized the way we write React components. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the most commonly used hooks and how they can make your code more readable and maintainable.\n\n## What are React Hooks?\n\nHooks are functions that let you \"hook into\" React state and lifecycle features from function components. They were introduced in React 16.8 and have become the standard way to write React components.\n\n## useState Hook\n\nThe useState hook allows you to add state to functional components:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## useEffect Hook\n\nThe useEffect hook lets you perform side effects in function components:\n\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nfunction Example() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\n        Click me\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. Always use hooks at the top level of your React function\n2. Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions\n3. Use custom hooks to share stateful logic between components\n4. Keep your effects focused and specific\n\nReact Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know. Happy coding!",

    "content": "# Building Healthy Habits That Actually Stick\n\nWe all want to build better habits, but why do so many of our attempts fail? Understanding the psychology of habit formation is key to creating lasting change.\n\n## The Habit Loop\n\nEvery habit consists of three parts:\n1. **Cue**: The trigger that initiates the behavior\n2. **Routine**: The behavior itself\n3. **Reward**: The benefit you get from the behavior\n\n## Why Habits Fail\n\n- Starting too big\n- Lack of clear triggers\n- No immediate rewards\n- Trying to change too many things at once\n- All-or-nothing thinking\n\n## The 1% Better Principle\n\nFocus on getting 1% better each day rather than dramatic changes. Small improvements compound over time into remarkable results.\n\n## Practical Strategies\n\n### 1. Start Ridiculously Small\n- Want to exercise? Start with 1 push-up\n- Want to read more? Start with 1 page\n- Want to meditate? Start with 1 minute\n\n### 2. Stack Your Habits\nAttach new habits to existing ones:\n\"After I pour my morning coffee, I will write in my gratitude journal.\"\n\n### 3. Design Your Environment\n- Make good habits obvious and easy\n- Make bad habits invisible and difficult\n\n### 4. Track Your Progress\nUse a simple habit tracker or calendar to mark your wins.\n\n### 5. Celebrate Small Wins\nAcknowledge every success, no matter how small.\n\n## Common Healthy Habits to Start With\n\n- Drinking more water\n- Taking daily walks\n- Eating one piece of fruit daily\n- Doing 5 minutes of stretching\n- Reading before bed instead of scrolling\n\n## The 21-Day Myth\n\nContrary to popular belief, it takes an average of 66 days to form a new habit, not 21. Be patient with yourself.\n\n## When You Slip Up\n\n- Don't break the chain twice in a row\n- Focus on getting back on track, not perfection\n- Learn from what caused the slip\n\nRemember: You don't have to be perfect, you just have to be consistent. Small changes, practiced daily, create extraordinary results over time.",
